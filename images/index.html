        When we protect the environment, we receive rain, which helps our crops 
        flourish and produce an abundant harvest.In such a season, everyone is 
        content and nobody will complain about shortage of food.In comparison, 
        an unconserved environment is this.
        In any case, this is not currently a top priority for me.Despite
        the fact that I don't engage in it myself, I have loved agriculture all of my life.
        My parents forbade my brothers and I from working in the fields, and even 
        then, it was only if we wanted to assist.Our future is brighter than that, 
        they repeatedly assured us.Even though I don't farm, I wanted 
        to contribute since I saw the difficulties they endure and I think that, 
        with the use of technology, I can assist the farmers.
